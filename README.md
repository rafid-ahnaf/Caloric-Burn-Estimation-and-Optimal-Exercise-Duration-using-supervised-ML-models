This project explores the application of a few popular supervised learning strategies for the quantitative estimation of caloric
burn and most optimal exercising duration to keep body temperature under control. Leveraging a dataset that incorporates more than
one capabilities like age, weight, height, heart rate, body temperature and exercising duration, the observe applies machine learning
knowledge of models including Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector
Regression. Through rigorous data preprocessing steps like missing value treatment and feature selection, the report lays the
groundwork for model training. While the paper does now not delve into the overall performance metrics in element, it emphasizes the
potential metrics that would be evaluated, inclusive of Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error and the RÂ²
Score. The report concludes by highlighting the potential of supervised models in providing more accurate and personalised estimates,
therefore contributing to advancements in the fields of fitness and health.
